We sync with Chromium release revision, which has both webkit revision and V8 revision.

http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bleeding_edge@2842

Incorporated the option to use a later version of v8 engine (svn revision 3610)
It is placed under V8Bindings/v8_leading, and
can be turned on by setting USE_ALT_JS_ENGINE := true
Also a V8 API mismatch bug has been fixed under WebCore/bindings/v8/ so that
the latest V8 javaScript engine can be used the version of webkit used in eclair 2.1
